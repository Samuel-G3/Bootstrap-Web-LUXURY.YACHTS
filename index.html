            2019 Benetti Custom Motoryacht With a timeless sculptural exterior
            from the board of sought-after designers RWD and a relaxed beach
            house-style interior by Benetti, she was built as the ultimate

            The coupé evolution. It's called Super, as it's amazing, and because
            this suffix is well-known as the mark of evolution within the Riva
            brand. 88’ Domino Super, aimed to set new standards in the industry
            in terms of style, comfort and performance, had its début in Monte
            Carlo, before being worldwide reveald to the public in September at
            the Cannes Yachting Festival. With an overall length of 26.84 metres
            (88 ft.) and a maximum beam of 6.29 metres (20.7’), its racy and
            aerodynamic profile wins you over from first glance, enhanced by the
            shade of the hull, the dark “London Grey” contrasting with the light
            “Moon Grey” of the superstructure.

            Aggressive and modern lines: these are the elements that
            characterize the series C FORCE. Among the most significant details
            of this class is certainly the large central double height glazing
            that meets the need to flow with as much natural light as possible
            to where it is needed most: the salon on the main and upper decks.
            In this way it is created the typical atmosphere of an attic. Seen
            from outside, the window appears as a vertical cut that does not
            interrupt in any way the external lines. All these features make it
            special series C FORCE, but the proportions are well balanced to
            make it timeless.
